## Long description

"The project aims to draw attention to the challenges faced by historic sites and propose a method for their preservation. These sites are exposed to various threats, with time being the most significant. This raises the crucial question: Do we have enough time to appreciate the legacy of past generations? The Old Cemetery in JarosÅ‚aw caught our team's attentionâ€”a sometimes deserted yet essential place for our human identity. We decided to use our skills and modern technologies to immortalize it in the best possible way by bringing it online. This will enable families of those buried there to visit their loved ones from anywhere in the world. Another pressing issue is preserving the memory of the heroes resting there. Delving into the history of this place allows us to rediscover what many have deemed long forgotten, and we aim to convey this to beneficiaries through a virtual 3D tour accompanied by interesting and touching stories."
